### Chapter 4 â€“ day 1

#### 1. Write a procedure that uses a for loop to print out the first 20 integers.

#### 2. Write a procedure that uses a for loop to find the sum of the first 100 integers.

#### 3. Write a function called fact() that will compute and print n!, n factorial. Recall that n! is defined so that
            0! = 1
            1! = 1
            2! = 2*1 = 2
            3! = 3*2*1 = 6
            4! = 4*3! = 4*3*2*1

Your function should have one parameter, m. 

Code outline:
```
def fact(m)
      <stuff>

fact(0)
fact(1)
fact(2)
fact(3)
fact(4)
fact(5)

Output:
1
1
2
6
24
120
```
